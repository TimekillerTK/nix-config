  # Fix for allowing user to login to GUI session with ZSH as default shell
  # - users.users.user.shell is set to zsh, but
  #      programs.zsh.enable is not true. This will cause the zsh
  #      shell to lack the basic nix directories in its PATH and might make
  #      logging in as that user impossible. You can fix it with:
  #      programs.zsh.enable = true;
  programs.zsh.enable = true;
