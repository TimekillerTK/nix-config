  # --- To find more info about your bluetooth audio device ---
  # -----------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # First connect the bluetooth device, next:
  # -> pw-cli ls Device
  #     This will list all device objects, you will see the ID of the bluetooth device
  #     here, like for example 69
  # -> wpctl inspect 69
  #     This will get more information about said device, providing properties such as:
  #     - "device.name"
  #     - "device.product.id"
  #     - "device.vendor.id"
  #
  # -----------------------------------------
  # --- To find where changes are applied ---
  # -----------------------------------------
  #
  # -> systemctl --user status wireplumber.service
  #     Drop-In will have a /nix/store path to overrides.conf. Catting
  #     that file will show `Environment="XDG_DATA_DIRS` which will
  #     point to the config directory.
  # -> cat /nix/store/xxx-wireplumber-configs/share/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/name-of-file.conf
  #     In /nix/store/xxx-wireplumber-configs/share follow the path to
  #     share/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/name-of-file.conf which is the file
  #     that contains the changes.
  # -> systemctl --user restart wireplumber pipewire
  #     Restart the wireplumber/pipewire services to see changes take effect
  # -> pactl list cards | grep -A 20 "bluez_card"
  #     Use this command WHILE HEADSET IS CONNECTED to check active Profiles
  # -----------------------------------------------------------

  # Limit Bluetooth to only use A2DP profiles, disabling Hands-Free mode
  # profiles entirely.
  #
  # Once this nix configuration is applied, don't forget to run:
  # -> systemctl --user restart wireplumber
